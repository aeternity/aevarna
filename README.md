# aevarna

This is the __varna__ compiler for the æternity system which compiles contracts written in __varna__ code to the æternity VM code.

For more information about æternity smart contracts and the varna language see [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/contracts/contracts.md) and the [Varna Language](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/contracts/varna.md).

It is an OTP application written in Erlang and is by default included in
[the æternity node](https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity). However, it can
also be included in other systems to compile contracts coded in varna which
can then be loaded into the æternity system.
